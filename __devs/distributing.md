# Distributing Package

Do not forget update version at ``jerimoon/__init__.py``

1. Create package:
    ```shell script
    # python setup.py sdist -d ./__dist
    python setup.py egg_info --egg-base ./__dist sdist -d ./__dist
    ```

1. Upload it to pypi (you must provide your pypi login and account):
    ```shell script
    twine upload __dist/jerimoon-A.B.C
    ```
